You can choose between:

- [Manual setup](#manual-setup) (more fun, recommended)
- [NPM installation](#npm-installation) (a lot less fun)
- [CDN](#cdn) (not fun either but good for quick prototyping)

## Manual installation

### 1. Prerequisites
If you haven't gotten Open Props UI setup yet, [do that first](/guide/getting-started) and then return.

### 2. Base setup



## NPM installation


## CDN

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/opui-blocks/
