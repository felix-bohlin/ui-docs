## When you're stuck

Often when I'm stuck the problem I'm working on is either overwhelming or unclear. Pick something you can accomplish within ten minutes. Brute-force your way into flow with tiny dopamine hits like that.

## Just start

On the topic of not knowing what to work on - yeah, think on it and walk through the problem in your head, but you'll never meditate your way through a tricky situation. Start working on the thing and you'll know what relevant problems you need to solve when you run into them.

## Don't assume you're done until you're done

... and even then you're probably not done. The point is that you don't know what's coming up next. Some new way of doing things might've dropped or maybe you've had a great idea. Be ready to change, kill your darlings and adapt to whatever's next.

## Be pragmatic

Some things don't need changing this exact moment. Don't change just because. Your time is valuable. As I said - be ready to change but be smart about it. Time spent now should save you time later.
